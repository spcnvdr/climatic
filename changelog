  * Allow up to 150 data points on the graph to show trends over a longer 
    period of time. Temporary change until switch to Flot.js

climatic (0.4.1) urgency=high;
  * Fixed a stupid bug in climatic.js that could return bad statistics if 
    a CSV file is uploaded with two data points with the first data point 
    being smaller in temperature or humidity. This was caused by using an 
    if-else instead of two separate if statements when looking for the 
    highest and lowest temperature/humidity.
  * Updated README.md to correctly describe the format of CSV file expected
