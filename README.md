# Climatic - Python 3.x.x Group Project Part 2

The purpose of this Git repository and its contents is for the experimentation
and development of the second part of the Internet of Things Group Project
part 2 for the Fall 2020 semester. 
The goal of this project is to create a single Flask web page that 
either allows users to upload a CSV file or to use the current CSV file 
maintained by the web server. The web page will download the CSV file from the 
user, parse its contents, and (if valid) display information about the contents
of the file. The file is to contain information in CSV format, with Linux/UNIX
line endings (LF). The data in the CSV file will contain the current
temperature, humidity, date and time of collection, and any other pertinent 
information that can be gathered and stored by either additional sensors or 
by the Raspberry Pi itself.

**The Software**

The software will use Python 3.x.x and Flask for the web server and WiringPi 
for the Python code that interacts with the DHT11 temperature & humidity 
sensor. The web server will use Bootstrap to style the page, jQuery to 
assist with the JavaScript, and possibly Flot or Morris.js to create 
pretty looking graphs, tables, line charts, etc. 

**To Setup or Run**

First, get a copy of this code

    git clone https://github.com/spcnvdr/climatic.git

Change into the web directory with cd

    cd climatic/src

Create the virtual environment if this is the first run

    python3 -m venv venv

Enable the virtual environment:

    source venv/bin/activate

Install any Python 3.x.x dependencies

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

Then run the main Python 3.x.x script

    ./main

Then open a web browser to port 5000 on the localhost:

    127.0.0.1:5000

By default, the web server will listen on any public IP address and can be 
reached by any device on the same network, so be careful!

The default credentials are:

    username: admin

    password: admin

**To Do**

- [ ] Determine the exact format of CSV files to use
- [ ] Finish the web page that will parse CSV files and display information
- [ ] ~~Make it possible to change the username and password~~
- [ ] Remove old, unneeded templates
- [ ] Use toasts for all alerts
- [x] Add space between menu bar and content on all pages, not just home
